\section{Centered n-gons}
Consider an n-gon with corners ${1,...,n}$ and a center point $0$. Now consider the simplicial complex consisting of the vertices $\{(1),...,(n)\}$, the edges $\{(0,1),...,(0,n),(1,2),...,(n-1,n),(1,n)\}$ and the triangles \\$\{(0,1,2),...,(0,n-1,n),(0,1,n)\}$. \\The following figure gives an example for a pentagon with a center point.

\PD{Will we get different results if the edegs in the external boundary are paired in the same way as the triangles?}

\begin{lemma}[Quadratic number of additions]
Let $K$ be a simplicial complex of an n-gon with center, as defined above. The filtration: 
\begin{center}
    $\{(n),...,(0),(n-1,n),(n-2,n-1),...,(1,2),(0,1),(0,2),...,(0,n),(1,n),...\}$
\end{center}
yields a boundarymatrix, for which the column reduction algorithm needs more than $\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \in \Omega(n^2)$ additions.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Coming soon.
\end{proof}

The following figure shows the plot of the number of simplices in the n-gon with center mapped to the number of additions needed by the column reduction algorithm. Note that the number of simplices equals $1+4n$.

Let $F$ be a filtration as in Lemma 3.1. for $n = 5$ The following figure shows a the output of the algorithm Filtration\_to\_DMF($F$).

\section{Conflicts along v-paths}
\begin{lemma}[Conflictfree 2-dim v-path]
Let $K$ be a simplicial complex and $V$ a gradient field on $K$. Let $p = (v_1,e_1,v_2,...,e_{n-1},v_n)$ be a v-path of vertices and edges in $V$. Let $F$ be the filtration given by the algorithm \textbf{DMF\_to\_Filtration}. Let $B_p$ be the submatrix of the boundary Matrix of $F$, that only consists of rows $v_1,...,v_n$ and columns $e_1,...,e_{n-1}$. It holds that $\low(i) = i+1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Note that in the full boundary matrix there might be columns or rows in between the rows and columns of $B_p$, but we will ignore those. \\
The v-path $p$ enforces that $v_1,...,v_n$ appear in that order. So $v_1$ before $v_2$ before $v_3$ and so on. The same holds for $e_1,...,e_{n-1}$. This means the $i$-th column, for $i \in \{i,...,n-1\}$ has non zero entries in the rows corresponding to $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$, since the simplex $e_i$ is adjacent to the simplices $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$. Since $v_{i+1}$ is the $(i+1)$-th row, the statement follows.
\end{proof}

\PD{I do not clearly see from that proof if there are no intermediate cells, of indices below the maximal index of an element in the V-Path, that do not creat conflicts. I do see that there will not be clnfilicts between elements of v-path, but what about elements of v-path and other simplices?}
